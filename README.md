# ABM-SIR Model for Modeling COVID-19 Spread

This repository contains an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** and **Susceptible‚ÄìInfected‚ÄìRecovered (SIR)** framework to study the spread of COVID-19.  
The project was developed as part of my master‚Äôs thesis in mathematics, with a focus on **mathematical modeling of infectious diseases**.
The purpose of this model is to understand and extend the modeling process of a disease progression inspired by "H. De-Leon and D. Aran" work.

## üìå ABM Model Functions
- Average :- To average the age specific sub groups in the population
- ComputeInfectious :- To generate unique infection days per variant type.
- HealthStatus :- To initalize the health status in the population.
- VaccineEffectiveness :- To create vaccine and natural induced immunity models.
- MAM :- To control the core process/algorithm of infection probability.
- Simulations :- The driver function to initialize, average, and generate plots.

## üìå SIR Model Functions
- SIRbasic :- Traditional susceptiblle, infected, recoevered model.
- SIRMultiAge :- Multi age-structured SIR model
- SIRMultiAgeTest :- The driver function to initialize, analyze and generate plots.

## Additional Files Used
- VaccinationRate.xlsx contains data on the vaccination rate in Israel as a function of time, divided into age groups.
- VaccRate_3gps :- MATLAB file that plots the vaccination rate data for 4 vaccination doses into age groups.
- Rt_Values.xlsx provides the data to calculate the variant specific theoretical reproduction number values.
- CC_Data.xlsx contains data on the daily confirmed cases and total number of population in Israel.
